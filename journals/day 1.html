            We’ve arrived in Shanghai to a warm, muggy day — and what a welcome! 
            The city is alive with energy, its skyline glowing into the night with soaring high-rise towers and dazzling lights. 
          </p>
          <p>
            From our hotel room we’re treated to a breathtaking view of the <strong>Oriental Pearl Tower</strong>, 
            standing at an impressive 1,500 feet — the 5th tallest in the world. Watching it sparkle against the night sky feels like stepping right into the heart of modern China. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Tomorrow promises plenty of adventure, but for now we’re a little jet-lagged and soaking up the excitement (and maybe a power nap or two 😆).
