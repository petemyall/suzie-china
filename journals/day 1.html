        <h1>Day 1: From Heathrow to Ni Hao Beijing!</h1>

        <div class="description-box">
          <p>After months of planning, packing, and practicing how to say “thank you” in Mandarin without panicking, we were finally off! Heathrow buzzed with excitement — and delays, of course — but Suzie handled it like a pro, fueled by coffee and duty-free perfume testing.</p>
          <p>The flight to Beijing was long, but not unpleasant — even the in-flight noodles were better than expected. We touched down in China’s capital early morning, blinking against the bright skyline and the sheer scale of the place. The air was crisp, the signs were all in Mandarin, and Suzie was already pointing at the first dumpling vendor she could see.</p>
          <p>Our hotel is tucked into a charming hutong near the Bell Tower — traditional grey-brick lanes with red lanterns, tiny shops, and locals cycling past with impossible amounts of cargo. Our room? Clean, compact, and equipped with a loo that sings when you flush. Modern meets ancient in the best way!</p>
          <p>In the afternoon, we explored Tiananmen Square and strolled along part of the Forbidden City wall. It’s impossible not to be awed by the vastness of it all — gold-tipped roofs, imperial red paint, and stone guardians staring down tourists with a kind of ancient side-eye.</p>
          <p>By sunset, we were sat on plastic stools slurping spicy noodles from a street stall while watching locals do tai chi in the park. Suzie declared it “the best first day of a holiday ever,” and frankly, I had to agree.</p>
